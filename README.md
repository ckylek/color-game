# Red Green & Blue Game
Javascript and HTML5 game where the goal is to match the given RGB value to the correct color option that is presented on the screen.  There are two game modes: Easy (Choose correctly from 3 options) and Hard (Choose correctly form 6 options).

## Description
This project a project I developed while practicing using JS functions and event listeners.  I have continued to add styling and some features to it over time.  The game works by using some bulit-in javascript object Math to generate random RGB values and push them into an array.  It will repear this process until there are a total of either 3 (Easy Mode) or 6 (Hard Mode) colors. These colors are displayed to the screen in squares contained in HTML divs. One of the newly generated colors will be selected randomly as the "Picked Color", this color's RGB values will be read and printed to the screen.  

The user is then able to intereact with the webpage by implementing a series of .addEventListeners, waiting to hear a click on the square that matches the RGB values of the "Picked Color".  Button options exists for the user to Reset the program or change the game difficuly.
